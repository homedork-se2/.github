### The nodes in the system
>The physical devices, such as lamps, fans and radiators. Every device is connected to a local hub which handles the communication to HomeDork's central server.
>
>The server is responsible for handling direct access and communication to the database and the communcation between all other essential parts of the system. 
>
>The API is the main communcation interface between the clients and the server. The API receives HTTP requests and handle them accordingly to stream the correspoinding query to the server on a secure TCP channel. 
>
>The clients are both a web and an android appliciation which are the interactive interfaces for the users. User authentication is handled by Firebase which then provides access to the API. Through the API connection, the users can control their devices connected to their HomeDork local hub.
